Virtualization stack deployment scenarios

Xen and KVM virtualization stacks can be deployed in a number of ways. In
traditional virtualization environments, deployments can be small and
customized for a specific purpose, or large monoliths that include
"everything plus the kitchen sink". For containerized environments, images
providing a KVM stack are available, as well as images providing
virtualization client tools such as virsh and virt-install. Kubevirt
containers also exist to extend a kubernetes cluster with virtualization
capabilities.

This talk will briefly describe the various virtualization packages and
containers, and explore ways in which they can be used to create
predefined and custom virtualization deployments in both traditional
virtualization environments and containerized environments.

Suggested length: 30 or 45 minutes
